## PROBLEM
You’re given an integer array, `nums`. Return a resultant array product so that product[i] is equal to the product of all the elements of `nums`` except `nums[i]`.

Write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time without using the division operation.

Constraints:
- 2≤ nums.length ≤103
- −30≤ nums[i] ≤30

The product of any prefix or suffix of `nums` is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.
